### Team Celebration & Recognition

As a team lead, I recognize the importance of celebrating both the collective achievements of the team and the individual efforts that contribute to our success. Whether it's the seamless collaboration on developing a login page or the upcoming challenge of integrating RERUM into our backend, every milestone reached represents a step forward in our project's progress. By acknowledging and commemorating these milestones, we not only boost morale but also foster a sense of unity and shared accomplishment among team members.

The collaborative effort demonstrated during the development of the login page serves as a prime example of our team's strength. Each member's dedication and effective communication played a pivotal role in achieving the milestone. It's essential to highlight and celebrate such instances of teamwork, as they reinforce the value of collaboration and encourage continued cooperation as we tackle future challenges.

Looking ahead, the upcoming milestone of integrating RERUM into our backend presents an exciting opportunity for growth and learning. As we delve into mastering the RERUM API and navigating the complexities of restructuring our backend, I'm confident that our team will rise to the occasion. To incentivize and motivate our efforts, I've planned a team outing to the zoo, followed by a movie screening upon successful completion of this milestone. This serves not only as a reward for our hard work but also as a chance to bond outside of the office and recharge our collective energy.

Furthermore, beyond these immediate milestones, I'm also planning a surprise for the team to commemorate our long-term goal of successfully delivering the project. While the details remain under wraps for now, I'm committed to ensuring that our achievements are duly recognized and celebrated every step of the way. By fostering a culture of appreciation and celebration, we not only boost morale but also reinforce our collective commitment to excellence and success.

### Backlog Prioritization
Information Radiator - Backlog prioritization

Project : Research Asset Management

An Information Radiator is something like a display that provides passive information in an easy to understand format. It should also provide opportunities to collaborate. Also the information should be updated at regular intervals. “The information should hit you as you are passing by”. As discussed in the class these are the good properties of an Information radiator. 

An information radiator provides different sorts of information regarding the project. One of the crucial information in an information radiator could be backlog and its prioritization. Backlog holds all the planned work. It holds different tasks we need to work on (blocks). We agreed to create a neat Webpage that shows different aspects of the project that we can regularly update.

Backlog prioritization is important for a project as it involves first planning ahead and then carefully selecting the work that requires more priority and forming an order like in a pipeline format. It also quickly shows the work/sprint the team is currently working on. Also looking at the work that must be completed after the current sprint helps in designing things that will be in sync to the components that come next. 

We have planned work that will keep us occupied for the next few sprints in the last meeting and this helped us in creating the element of backlog prioritization in our Information Radiator website. (With 10 other components) We carefully placed our planned work in an order of low to high priority in the backlog which you can see in the website under backlog prioritization. 

Currently we are working to create API’s with backend support and then we have to integrate front and backend, Implement advance filtering, Make further changes to UI, Routing correction, Footer work in home page, Connecting all our work to one database. To order all of these important tasks (blocks) in a backlog order (pipeline) We created a figma design of priority order which we then placed in the element block reserved for that in our Information Radiator website. 

As we need to update the backlog with what comes next and their order, which requires careful planning and collaboration, we can make use of figma to make a design and update that in our website. This places emphasis on the collaboration phase which is crucial in development.
