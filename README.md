## Component 1: Current sprint progress
Provides visibility into the progress of the current sprint, helping the team track work completed versus work remaining. This promotes transparency and enables timely adjustments to meet sprint goals.This can be implemented using a simple burndown chart.
->A burndown chart is a graphical representation of work remaining plotted against time during a project or sprint.
->By tracking progress regularly using burndown charts, teams can identify issues or potential roadblocks early on and take corrective actions to stay on track.
->Burndown charts help teams predict when the project or sprint will be completed based on the current rate of progress, allowing for better planning and resource allocation.
->Overall, burndown charts are valuable tools for Agile teams to track and manage project progress effectively, enabling them to deliver high-quality results on time
