# Incident and Bug Tracking Component

As team members we are responsible for the Research Asset Tracking development project, me and Bharath have taken the task of creating an information radiator for Incident and bug tracking component of our project. One crucial component of this radiator is the Incident and Bug Tracking module, which plays a vital role in ensuring the smooth operation and quality of our software.

## Bug Tracking

The Bug Tracking component serves as a central repository for logging and monitoring bugs encountered during the development process. It provides essential information such as:

- **Bug Name**: Each bug is identified by a unique name or identifier, making it easier for team members to reference and track.

- **Bug Status**: This indicates the current state of the bug, whether it's under work, needs work, or resolved. Having clear statuses helps prioritize and manage bug fixes effectively.

## Incident Management

In addition to tracking bugs, the Incident Management functionality handles various types of incidents that may occur during the project lifecycle. These incidents could range from system crashes to security breaches or unexpected errors. The components includes:

- **Incident Type**: Categorizes incidents based on their nature, such as technical issues, security breaches, usability concerns, Bugs, documentation, duplicate, enhancement, good first issue, help wanted, invalid, question, won't fix.

## Importance in Project Development

Integrating the Incident and Bug Tracking component into our project is crucial for several reasons:

- **Quality Assurance**: By systematically recording and addressing bugs and incidents, we uphold the quality standards of our software, ensuring a positive user experience.

- **Efficient Collaboration**: Team members can easily communicate and collaborate on resolving issues by referencing the Bug Tracking module, fostering efficient problem-solving and teamwork.

- **Continuous Improvement**: Tracking incidents allows us to identify recurring issues or patterns, enabling us to implement preventive measures and continuously improve our development processes.

## Commitment to Excellence

As we incorporate the Incident and Bug Tracking component into our project, we reaffirm our commitment to delivering a high-quality product. Actively monitoring and addressing issues, makes the team to stay updated and stay on the same page.
