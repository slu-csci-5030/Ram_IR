# Project Tech Stack Documentation Links

Our project leverages a variety of technologies to create a robust and scalable asset management system. Below are links to the documentation for the main technologies we're using. These resources should help team members and contributors quickly get up to speed with our tech stack and contribute more effectively.

## Frontend

### React

- **React** is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. We use React to build our component-based UI.
  - [React Documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)

### Vite

- **Vite** is a build tool that significantly improves the frontend development experience. It offers fast cold starts and instant hot module replacement (HMR).
  - [Vite Documentation](https://vitejs.dev/guide/)

### CSS

- **CSS** is used for styling our components. We follow best practices to ensure our application is responsive and accessible.
  - [CSS Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)

## Backend

### Express.js

- **Express.js** is a web application framework for Node.js, designed for building web applications and APIs. It has been used to set up the server-side logic of our project.
  - [Express.js Documentation](https://expressjs.com/)

## Database

### MongoDB

- **MongoDB** is a NoSQL database that offers high performance, high availability, and easy scalability. We use MongoDB to store and manage our application's data efficiently.
  - [MongoDB Documentation](https://docs.mongodb.com/)

## Additional Tools and Libraries

### ESLint

- **ESLint** is a static code analysis tool for identifying problematic patterns found in JavaScript code. It helps us maintain code quality standards.
  - [ESLint Documentation](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/getting-started)

### Build and Deployment Status
In our Build and Deployment Status, we actively address issues encountered by team members during code development. For instance, if a Team Member encounters an issue, they'll comment on the problem, followed by its status. Other team members with potential solutions will reach out to assist and the status changes appropriately.

# Build and deployment status

In our **Build and Deployment status** process, we actively address issues encountered by team members during code development. For instance, if Team Member 1 encounters a frontend ReactJS issue, they'll comment on the problem, marked in *red* as *(PENDING)*, followed by its status. Other team members with potential solutions will reach out to assist.

Similar scenarios have arisen in our project:

**Issue 1**:
Raised by *Ashwin*, highlighting conflicts with different versions of libraries and frameworks for asset management functionality. Initially marked as pending, a team member later aided in resolving the problem, turning it *green* *(RESOLVED)*. Similar methodologies were applied to **Issue 3** by *Ajith* and **Issue 5** by *Sagar*.

**Issue 2**:
Raised by *Bharath*, involving version control conflicts during work on the Delete Asset feature. This issue remains unresolved, marked in red (PENDING). Meanwhile, team members are actively addressing Bharath's problem. Same in **Issue 4**, raised by *Puneeth*, this issue is being actively worked on while marked as pending.
