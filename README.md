COMPONENT-5:USER STORY MAPPING
The User Story Mapping component serves as a vital tool for understanding and visualizing the diverse needs and requirements of our users. It allows us to map out different personas and their respective goals, frustrations, and requirements within our project.
Each persona is represented as a clickable link within the User Story Mapping section. The HTML structure consists of <div> elements containing the personas' names and descriptions.
